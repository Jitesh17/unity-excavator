# unity-excavator

This project is a cumulation of my weekend works on Unity, to operate an 3D model excavator on Unity.

I am using Blender to make 3D models these days, but blender files of the models used in this project are not included in this project.

Note: I am working on Windows10 for this creation.

## Requirements

- Unity 2018.4
- Logicool Gamepad F310
