Note: I am working on Windows10 for this creation. I have used Blender to create the 3D model of excavator.

## Requirements

- Unity 2018.4
- [Standard Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-for-unity-2017-3-32351)
- Optional: [Logicool Gamepad F310](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gamepads/f310-gamepad.940-000110.html)

## My weekend works

- [Excavator simulation](./doc/Excavator.md)
- [Depth camera simulation](./doc/DepthCamera.md)
- Converting LAS point cloud data to Unity's Terrain object
- Lazer range finder simulation
- Terrain height map manipulation
- Transferring JPEG images from Unity's cameras to an Android app via MQTT messaging bus
- Controlling digital twin from a joystick simulation app via MQTT messaging bus
- Using Unity's camera for AI object detection with MobleNet on TensorFlow
- Digital twin synchronizing with a real servo motor via real CAN bus
- Transferring data from virtual sensors to MQTT messaging bus over private LoRa.
