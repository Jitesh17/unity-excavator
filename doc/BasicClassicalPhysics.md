# Basic classical Physics

This project has multiple scenes:

- Free fall
- Pendulum
- Slope
- Vector
- Friction

I have confirmed that all the Physics experiments on Unity follow the lows of Classical Physics.

## Free fall

## Slope

## Vector

# Friction

Comparison between Unity's Physics and Physics in real world Physics.

There are multiple scenes in "BasicClassicalPhysics\Assets\Scenes".
